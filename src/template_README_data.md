- If the raw data was simulated for this project, a general description of its properties should be provided, along with the script used to generate it. The script must be stored in the same folder. Specific instructions on how to use the script to regenerate the data must be included (for example as aREADME file) next to the script.


## Processed Data

- This folder contains data that has been preprocessed for analysis.
- A general description of the preprocessing steps and the rationale behind them should be included.
