# Source Code (`src/`) Directory

This directory contains all code-based files used to generate products (e.g., figures, tables) for one or multiple manuscripts, reports, or presentations related to the project.  

## Structure and Guidelines

- Usage instructions for scripts must be documented to ensure users can execute them correctly.  
- Each function should have a **clear but concise** description of its purpose, required inputs, expected outputs, and dependencies (e.g., **R**: `roxygen2`, **Python**: docstrings).  
- If applicable, instructions on how to run the script (e.g., command-line arguments, execution order) should be included in a `README.md` file or within the script itself.  
- Scripts should be modular and reusable to **minimise duplication** across projects.  
- Outputs should **not** be manually copiedâ€”scripts must generate them in their intended locations.
