# Project Documentation

This README provides a **baseline** for documenting your project, ensuring reproducibility and organisation. Modify as needed to suit your workflow.

The goal is to help the next person quickly understand how data, figures, tables, and other outputs are generated and organised, minimising time spent deciphering the workflow.

---

# Project Name  

Provide a **brief** overview of:

- Project objective

- Data summary

- General analysis methods


# Project  Structure  

This project is organised into the following directories:  

- `analysis/` – Stores temporary script results.
- `code_review/` – Helps a "code buddy" reproduce manuscripts, presentations, and reports.
- `data/` –  Contains raw and processed data.
- `manuscripts/`, `presentations/`, and `reports/` – Store outputs for different sub-projects.
- `src/` – Houses code files for generating outputs.

### `data/`
**Do not keep multiple copies** of the data.

- **Raw Data**: Describe its source, location, or how to regenerate it if applicable.
- **Processed Data**: Document preprocessing steps and scripts used.

### `code_review/`

Provide details to help a reviewer reproduce your work.

### `manuscripts/`, `presentations/`, and `reports/`

- Each figure/table must have an associated script or reference to its source in src/.

- Avoid redundant copies; outputs should be generated by scripts. Example: figure `manuscript/figures/001_fabulous_figure.png`, must be generated by a script with the same name and location: `manuscript/figures/001_fabulous_figure.R`.

### `src/`

- Use clear function descriptions (inputs, outputs, dependencies).
- Scripts should be modular and automate output generation.
