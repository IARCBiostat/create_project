# Project Directory Structure

This suggested directory structure is designed to ensure **reproducibility, clarity, and efficient project organisation**. You are free to make improvements and modifications if they enhance **reproducibility** and **organisation** in your specific context.  

This project is organised into three main directories:  

- `data/` – Contains raw and processed data used in the project.  
- `manuscripts/`, `presentations/`, and `reports/` – You may rename these directories based on your sub-project definition (e.g., a report, presentation, or manuscript). There may be multiple directories following this structure, depending on the number of reports, presentations, or manuscripts in this project. Each directory stores the figures, tables, and other products associated with the sub-project.  
- `src/` – Contains all code-based files required to generate the products (e.g., figures, tables).  

Each subdirectory includes its own `README.md` with detailed guidelines on its contents and usage. Refer to those files for more information.
