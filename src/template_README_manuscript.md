# Manuscript, Report, or Presentation Directory

This directory contains all the information required to generate the products (figures, tables, etc.) used in the manuscript, report, or presentation.

## Structure and Guidelines

- Each product (e.g., figures, tables) must be accompanied by the script (or a reference to its location in the `src/` directory) and instructions required to generate it.  
- There should only be **one** copy of each product (figure, table, etc.) and **one** corresponding script to generate it. Avoid manually copying and pasting products between directories.  
- [Optional] The script can be stored in the same location as the product instead of a separate directory.  

### Example:
For a figure located in `manuscript/figures/001_fabulous_figure.png`, the script or instructions to generate it should be stored in the same folder. This applies to all other products such as tables and supplementary materials.  

Following this structure ensures reproducibility and prevents redundant copies.
